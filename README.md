# My Portfolio

## This is my repository for my main project during the web development course.

I currently have a very simple draft for my plan, which is to make a simple portfolio for my different projects here and there.
The website will consist of 6 subdivisions;
* About me
* Portfolio
  * Artworks
  * Programming
  * Modding
* Contact
* 3rd-party lisences

### About me
This section will include a very brief description of me, my interests and goals.

### Portfolio
This will be the main section of the website, and also the landing-page.
In the main section all the different subsections will be displayed, the buttons will mostely be there for the purpose of filtering and ease-of-access for mobile users.
* #### Artworks
  * Here I will link to and/or post various artowrks I have made over the years.
* #### Programming
  * This section will link to my different github projects.
* #### Modding
  * This section will host and link to various mods I've created over the years.

### Contact
This section will include variouss channels in which to contact me.

### 3rd-party lisences
Here I will acknowledge and link to any and all 3rd-party resources I've made use of.
These may include, but are not limited to:
* Fonts
* JS Libraries
* Iconography

## Design
I am currently thinking of a design that will look roughly as follows, note however, that this is subject to change.
#### Main layout

##### With the menu extended

## Time budget
I am fairly confident I can achieve this within the alotted time, barring any major issues or bugs.
